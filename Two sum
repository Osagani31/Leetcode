//Q1-Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}  # Dictionary to store number and its index
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], index]  # Found the pair
        num_map[num] = index  # Store the current number's index
